decisions of a single person or handful of people and we are always of the millions.
Our name for this is fate.</p>

    I strapped in all tit in the casing. Twas a big copper thing made from scrap and a shitty seatbelt,
    freshly stolen from some maggotbrain low tier wizard. Good shit, getting your car stolen, idiot!
    Fuckin glory in the hole, my man. I giggled my true name and hit my chest. Like graphene.
</p>
<p>I shouted: "U BETTER NOT MISS, CUMBLADDER"</p>
<p>"FUCK U!", she shouted back. and ...</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    Fire!
</p>

    My ass lit up. Pants liretally burning. Melted with the casing, bottom broken through. Couldn't hold it, so I screamed like a cartoon freak.
    But the sound barrier was already broken. Adrenaline rushed. All rushing, pumping, blood through my mind and bare think.
    My minimum remained. I squeeled all silent, full tasmanian, and fucked right out my seat. Wind freezburned me, but my skin was to tough.

    and yet horrific sight: the city of build, creashed, rebuild and crashed: the place of sweet nightmarees and grim: poor and yet sexy:
    Uberlin.
