<h1>SOUNDING THE TRUMPET OF TRANS REBELLION</h1>

<p style="font-style: italic;">
    "The Greatest Cruelty is this: A million people may be subject to the
    decisions of a single person or handful of people and we are always of the millions.
    Our name for this is fate.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    But for the sake of our own bodies, we must deny the fates."

<p>"Alright, Imma shoot ya out the cannon in 57 seconds, ok!?" she shouted barely loud enough to outvolume
the city noice.</p>

    I strapped in all tit in the casing. Twas a big copper thing made from scrap and a shitty seatbelt,
    freshly stolen from some maggotbrain low tier wizard. Good shit, getting your car stolen, idiot!
    Fuckin glory in the hole, my man. I giggled my true name and hit my chest. Like graphene.
</p>
<p>I shouted: "U BETTER NOT MISS, CUMSQUATSH"</p>
<p>"FUCK U!", she shouted back, and ...</p>
<p>
    Nothing.
</p>
<p>
    FIRE!
</p>
<p>
    My ass lit up. So loud that tinitus entered my braintubes. Pants literally burning. Melted with the casing, bottom broken through.
    Couldn't hold it, so I screamed like a cartoon freak.
    But the sound barrier was already broke. Adrenaline rushed. All rushing, pumping, blood through my mind and bare think.
    My minimum remained. I squeeled all silent, full tasmanian, and fucked right out my seat. Wind freezburned me, but my skin was real tough.
</p>
<p>
    Then it all calmed down for the longest of all split seconds. My eyes were crying, my body floated, and I saw from the heavens a most beatiful
    and yet horrific sight: the city build, creashed, rebuild and recrashed, evercyclic: the place of sweet nightmares and grim: arm, aber sexy:
    Uberlin.
    In this tranquil moment, all my body went soft. Drool left my mouthhole, sticking to my face, and I pissed my pants right then and there.
    Strangely, I couldn't have cared less. All was good.
</p>
<p>
    Then I fell. Floatingly, compared to before the least. Barely air, couldn't breath enough, so I half passed oout. Yet,
    the drone was there, right in front, closer and yet closer. They had a delivery to the charite, Uberlins most biggest hospital.
    Delivery by drone to the highest floor, cuz they thought we couldn't reach. Poor rich, always underestimating the power of
    a few very determined individuals. My whole body tickled, even the artificial parts. From my brain over wifi , through the air,
    barely functional, to my limbs, I started with the rocketboothers to slow my fall and target.
</p>
<p>
    With a clunk anbd small crater in the hull, my landing cought.
